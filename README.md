## Overview

In Abuja, Nigeria, the real estate market faces significant challenges that hinder both investors and developers. The high cost of entry, lack of access to liquid funds, and rising construction costs due to inflation create a market that is inaccessible to many potential investors and strained for developers. This situation results in insufficient housing availability, sub-standard construction quality, and expensive housing prices, both for purchase and rental. xHousing aims to address these multifaceted issues by leveraging blockchain technology to democratise real estate investment and provide developers with much-needed liquidity.
